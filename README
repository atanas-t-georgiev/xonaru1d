Based on the reverse engineering work of Alessandro Pignotti

This program is part of the 'xonaru1service' project.
See https://github.com/atanas-t-georgiev/xonaru1service for more information.

'xonaru1d' provides communication interface to Xonar U1 thru socket.
It is used by 'xonaru1service' to communicate with the device.


REQUIREMENTS:

- Linux Kernel with support for HIDRAW
- Recent version of gcc
- make

The program is tested on Debian 7.3 

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

- cd to the directory where 'Makefile' is
- type 'make'

USAGE:

The program is meant to be run as a system service with 'root' privileges.

Usage: xonaru1d [ipc_port] [hiddev_prefix] [dev_from] [dev_to]

[ipc_port] - The TCP port on which 
'xonaru1d' will listen for connections from 'xonaru1service'.

[hiddev_prefix] - Usually '/dev/hidraw' 

If [dev_from] is N and [dev_to] is M, 
the program will search for Xonar U1 device from hiddev_prefixN to hiddev_prefixM.

Example: xonaru1d 17777 /dev/hidraw 0 5

In this configuration the program will listen for connections on 'localhost:17777'
and will check all devices from /dev/hidraw0 to /dev/hidraw5.

The device may or may not be connected when 'xonaru1d' is started.
It will be discovered once it's connected.
If it gets unplugged and then plugged again, Linux may assign it a new number.
Again, it will be discovered, as long as the new number is between [dev_from] and [dev_to].

For [ipc_port] You can choose random port number,
it doesn't matter as long as it's not already bind.

For [hiddev_prefix], just put /dev/hidraw

For [dev_from], 0 is always a good value.

For [dev_to], the number of your USB ports will be sufficient.
Note that many laptops have various integrated devices attached to USB.
So if you have 4 ports on the outside, you may actually have 6 ports in total.
